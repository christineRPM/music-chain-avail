# Sound Files Directory

Place your sound files in this directory. The app currently supports the following audio formats:
- .mp3
- .wav
- .ogg

To use your own sounds:
1. Add your sound files to this directory
2. Update the `SoundGrid.tsx` component to use your sound files instead of the oscillator

Example structure:
```
sounds/
  ├── sound1.mp3
  ├── sound2.mp3
  ├── sound3.mp3
  └── ...
```
